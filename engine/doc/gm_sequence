The following steps apply only to normal turns.  For the setup turn,
first create the galaxy using the NewGalaxy and MakeHomes programs.
Then generate the star list (ListGalaxy -p) and map files (MapGalaxy).
Next, for each player run the HomeSystem and AddSpecies programs.  After
this has been done for all species, run Finish and Report.  Finally,
continue with step 3 below.
Before you do, verify if the galaxy does not contain duplicate star
systems (planets) - ListGalaxy |sort|uniq -cd|less
If it does - regenerate.

1. As orders come in, copy them to the appropriate spNN.ord files in the
fh/game directory.  (You may want to use script "fhorders" to do this
automatically.)

2. After all orders have been received, run NoOrders, Combat,
PreDeparture, Jump, Production, PostArrival, Locations, Strike, Finish,
and Report (in that order).  Script "fhtest" and "fhsave" were written
to automate this process.

3. Run the "fhreports" script.  It will mail the reports to the players.

4. Run the "fhclean" script.  It will delete all temporary files that
were used during the turn, and copy all data and report files to backup
directories.
