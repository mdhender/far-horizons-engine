Note: this is out-of-date!


The computer will automatically generate default orders for you if I do
not receive your orders on time.  Thus, if you quit the game, your species
will continue on "auto-pilot" until you return, until I find a replacement
player, or until I give up.  In effect, your species will temporarily become
a "non-player" species.  Default orders will be generated as follows:

	1. If a non-self-sufficient colony has CUs and IUs or AUs in its
		inventory, appropriate INSTALL orders will be issued.

	2. If a transport is carrying CUs, if it is orbiting or landed on
		a non-self-sufficient colony, and if it is NOT in the home
		system, then it will be given an UNLOAD order if doing so
		will not exceed the 250.0 base limit.

	3. If a non-self-sufficient colony has available population units,
		they will be converted to colonist units, and an appropriate
		number of colonial mining and manufacturing units will be
		built.  (The computer will not exceed the 250.0 limit.)

	4. For each ship that is still under construction, as much additional
		construction as possible will be done based on available funds.

	5. For each starbase you own, the size will be increased as much as
		possible, limited only by your manufacturing technology and
		available funds.

	6. All remaining funds will be evenly allocated to research.  If
		a tech level is zero, then it will NOT be researched.

	7. The gamemaster may intervene if he feels that a player is taking
		advantage of a non-player species in a highly unrealistic
		manner.  This intervention will be extremely subtle, and the
		cheater will not even know it's happening.  Heh, heh, heh.


All of the above is subject to change.  Let me know what you think.
