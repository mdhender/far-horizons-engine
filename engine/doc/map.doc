This documentation and the accompanying program are

This program was inspired by a MegaTraveller subsector map generating
program by Travis McCord (mccord@equinox.unr.edu).

Changes from Version 1.0.

Some small bugs (such as the program not compiling on some systems) have
been fixed. The text size for printing the star names, etc, on the map
has been reduced, in order to allow more stars on the one map without
crowding the text. A three-dimensional plot style has been added, which
is much nicer and easier to use than the stereo-pair plot. Comments may
be included in the data files on lines beginning with '/' characters.

Changes from Version 2.0

More small bugs have been fixed. The program now accepts planetary orbit
data too, and plots orbital diagrams - although this option is not fully
functional yet.


Compiling the Source Code.

The accompanying program source code, map.c, should be compiled with a
C compiler. For example, on a Unix system type
     cc -o map map.c -lm
(the -lm is needed to link the mathematics library).

This documentation will assume that the resulting executable code is
named "map", but it may just as well be renamed to anything else.

The code is written to produce output suitable for A4 paper. If you use
US letter paper, you should use your favourite text editor to change
line 16 of the source code from:

/*  #define USPAPER  */

to:

#define USPAPER

before compiling.  (NB. The '#' character must be the first character on
the line after doing this modification.)


Using the Program.

Map is a program which takes a data file, listing coordinates, names and
spectral types of stars, and produces a postscript map of the stars. It is
suitable for producing star maps for role playing games such as GURPS
Space, etc. The maps a fairly generic, and could probably be used with
most SF RPGs.

A sample data file accompanies this program. The format of a data file line
is as follows:

          x,     y,    z,  starname,  spectral_type.  comments
eg.
       4.32, -2.45, 0.57,  {a} Indi,  K3 V.  A boring old star.

The three numbers give the coordinates of the star in a 3D cartesian
coordinate system. The name of the star may include spaces and punctuation
characters other than commas. The '{' and '}' characters delimit characters
which are to be interpreted as greek letters, as per the following table:

a   alpha               k   kappa            u   upsilon
b   beta                l   lambda           v   omega(variant)
c   chi                 m   mu               w   omega
d   delta               n   nu               x   xi
e   epsilon             o   omicron          y   psi
f   phi                 p   pi               z   zeta
g   gamma               q   theta            \260   degree symbol
h   eta                 r   rho              \300   aleph
i   iota                s   sigma            \112   theta(variant)
j   phi(variant)        t   tau              \126   sigma(variant)

(Note that these are the standard postscript definitions for the Symbol
font. The list can be extended to include all the Symbol encoded characters.)

The spectral type is defined as in standard astronomical notation,
comprising of a letter from the sequence 'OBAFGKM', followed immediately
by a single digit, a space and a roman numeral from 'I' to 'V'.

The punctuation of the data lines must follow the example given, with
commas separating the data elements, and a full stop ('period' to the
Americans) terminating the line. Anything after the full stop is ignored,
so this space may be used for comments. A '/' character at the beginning
of a line also denotes comments. Anything on a line beginning with a '/'
will be ignored by the program.

The sample data file 'sol' lists the stars in the neighbourhood of our sun.
This file lists accurate, real life data, with the coordinates in parsecs.
The x-y plane is the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy, the z-axis points
towards Galactic north, and the x-axis points towards the Galactic core.
For an example of the program at work, simply type
            map sol
and print the resulting file sol.ps. Note that the output is postscript,
which may be printed as graphics on a Unix machine using
            lw -X sol.ps


This is a reproduction of the map Usage message:

Usage: map [-xyzt | -p] [-sncdgro] [-l blh blv mw | -L xmin ymin zmin mw]
           [-h planeheight] filename

The default usage corresponds to:     map -z filename

-x, -y, -z : These options result in postscript output which prints a
             two-dimensional map of the stars in the given data file.
             The output is stored in a file with the same file name as
             the input data, with the suffix '.ps' appended. When printed,
             this file produces the map and a sheet listing the star data.
             The -x, -y or -z option specifies which axis to 'collapse'
             in the two-dimensional output plot.

-xy, -yz, -zx : These are equivalent to the -z, -x and -y options,
             respectively. They specify the two uncollapsed axes.

-p, -xyz : These two choices are identical. They produce a map in the
           form of a stereo-pair of images. If one image is observed with
           the left eye, and the other with the right eye, a three
           dimensional effect is achieved. No star data sheet is produced.

-t : Generates a three-dimensional plot using standard oblique projection.
     The -x, -y and -z options specify which reference plane to use. The
     two "uncollapsed" axes are plotted in a horizontal projected plane
     and the third axis is plotted vertically on the page.

-s : Displays the star spectral types on the map. (Default: not displayed.)

-n : Displays the star names on the map. (Default: not displayed.)

-c : Displays the star 'collapsed' coordinates on the map.
     (Default: not displayed.)

-d : Suppresses the production of the star data sheet.
     (Default: sheet produced.)

-g : Suppresses the grid lines on a two-dimensional map.
     (Default: grid lines displayed.)

-o : Draw a planetary orbit map of each star with planetary data. This
     option is not yet fully functional, but will produce correct orbit
     plots with no labelling. (Default: no orbit plot.)

-r : Displays a vertical reference plane as well as the horizontal one in
     the three-dimensional plot. This option will be implemented in a
     future release. (Default: not displayed.)

-l blh blv mw : Defines the two-dimensional map location and size. The
                blh and blv parameters give the Bottom Left Horizontal
         and Vertical coordinates for the map. Note that these will
         correspond to x/y with the -z option, y/z with the -x option,
         and z/x with the -y option. The mw parameter defines the Map
         Width, in the same units as the coordinates.
         (Default: auto-scaling.)

-L xmin ymin zmin mw : Defines the three-dimensional map location and
                       size. The xmin, ymin and zmin parameters give the
         minimum x, y and z coordinates for the map. The mw parameter
         defines the Map Width, in the same units as the coordinates.
         (Default: auto-scaling.)

-h planeheight : Defines the map coordinate of the reference plane height
                 in the three-dimensional plot.


Further Notes.

The stars on the two- and three-dimensional plots are scaled in size
according to their spectral type. A key is printed on the map sheet for
reference. In the stereo-pair plot, the stars are scaled in size
according to their distance from the observer point.

The -l option can be used to produce small maps of subsets of the data
file. If several of these are produced, they could be pasted together
edge to edge to form very large maps.

Grid lines on the map are auto-scaled to produce a reasonable number of
grids, at sensible intervals.


Bugs.

In a two-dimensional plot, if there are many stars and you print the names,
spectral types and/or compressed coordinates, the lettering may obscure
some of the other stars. The solution is to print maps of smaller regions
using the -l option and paste them together.

Not really a bug, but the stereo-pair plot produced by the -p option
is very difficult to view properly without a special stereo-image viewer.
This option will probably not be very useful to most people.

Also not really a bug, but the -r option has not yet been implemented.

If you find anything else which might be a bug, please notify me.
